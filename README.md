### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on ...

**STARS** - Sharing Tools and Artefacts for Reusable Simulations in Healthcare - [GitHub organisation](https://github.com/pythonhealthdatascience)

<a href="https://github.com/pythonhealthdatascience">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pythonhealthdatascience/stars-logo/refs/heads/main/stars_banner.png" alt="STARS logo and banner">
</a>

I am working on the STARS project from **May 2024 to April 2026**. Highlights so far:

* [Computational reproducibility assessments](https://pythonhealthdatascience.github.io/stars_wp1_summary/) of eight published discrete-event simulation studies in health. For each study, I attempted reproduce any results tables, figures and in-text results. I also evaluated the repository and article against various guidelines and criteria. For each assessment, the results are shared as a quarto site, with the repository structured as a "researched compendium", and test-run by a second team member.

* [Modifications to the "Exeter Oncology Model: Renal Cell Carcinoma edition (EOM-RCC)"](https://github.com/pythonhealthdatascience/stars-eom-rcc). This is a model associated with technology appraisals from the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE), which was developed by the Peninsula Technology Assessment Group (PenTAG). I worked on this model to improve its open science credentials, developing a [clear README](https://github.com/pythonhealthdatascience/stars-eom-rcc), [website hosting detailed documentation](https://pythonhealthdatascience.github.io/stars-eom-rcc/), and a [pilot web application for exploring treatment sequences](https://amyheather.shinyapps.io/shinyapp/).

### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™ve previously worked on ...

<details><summary><b>Kailo - Delivery #BeeWell (a school-based wellbeing survey) with schools in Northern Devon</b></summary>

<br>

<img align="right" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amyheather/amyheather/refs/heads/main/images/beewell_kailo_colour_logo.png" alt="Kailo #BeeWell" height="200">

I worked on Kailo from **October 2022 to April 2024**. My role was related to set-up and delivery of the #BeeWell survey, and the creation of dashboards to share results with schools and other stakeholders. #BeeWell was a school-based wellbeing survey being completed by secondary school pupils in Northern Devon in the academic year 2023-24. There were two versions of the survey - a standard survey being delivered at seven mainstream schools, and a symbol version being delivered at two non-mainstream schools. [This video](https://youtu.be/vt5fpE0bzSY) below provides a helpful introduction to the survey. It was designed to introduce young people to the survey. You can find out more about the survey at <https://kailo.community/beewell/>.

We planned to share results from the survey will be shared using dashboards (with dashboards for school-level and area-level dashboards). These are publically available with synthetic data. These have been produced using Streamlit.

* GitHub repository: [https://github.com/kailo-beewell](https://github.com/kailo-beewell)
* Package used to produce dashboards: [kailo-beewell-dashboard](https://github.com/kailo-beewell/kailo_beewell_dashboard_package).
* Streamlit dashboards:
    * Standard survey school dashboard - [![Dashboard example](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://synthetic-beewell-kailo-standard-school-dashboard.streamlit.app/)
    * Symbol survey school dashboard - [![Dashboard example](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://synthetic-beewell-kailo-symbol-school-dashboard.streamlit.app/)
    * Area-level dashboard - [![Dashboard example](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://synthetic-beewell-kailo-public-dashboard.streamlit.app/)

My time on this project ended during the survey collection window. At this point, several schools had begun successfully completing the survey, and I had developed three synthetic dashboards which were very nearly complete. Before leaving, I spent a few months explaining the survey and dashboards to two colleagues at Dartington Service Design Lab, who took over the survey delivery and analysis from the point when I left the project. As such, I am no longer responsible for maintenance of these dashboards.

<details><summary><b>IPACS - Improving Patient flow between Acute, Community and Social care</b></summary>

<br>

In **March and April 2023**, I contributed to the discrete-time model on IPACS.

I worked through the code for the model, rewriting and simplifying to improve clarity, adding comments and docstrings, and identifying and fixing bugs (as detailed [here](https://github.com/AliHarp/IPACS_MODEL)). This contributed to the [final repository hosted with NHS BNSSG Analytics](https://github.com/nhs-bnssg-analytics/ipacs-model).

I also created an example of converting part of the model (the visit-based simulation) into an R package, [as in this repository](https://github.com/amyheather/ipacs). This is supported by a [website](https://amyheather.github.io/ipacs/) that provides an overview of how to run the model, and information about the model functions.
