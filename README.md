<details><summary><b>Kailo - Delivery #BeeWell (a school-based wellbeing survey) with schools in Northern Devon</b></summary>

<img align="right" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amyheather/amyheather/refs/heads/main/images/beewell_kailo_colour_logo.png" alt="Kailo #BeeWell" height="200">

I worked on Kailo from October 2022 to April 2024. My role was to help set-up, deliver and deliver dashboards for the #BeeWell survey. This was a school-based wellbeing survey being completed by secondary school pupils in Northern Devon in the academic year 2023-24. There were two versions of the survey - a standard survey being delivered at seven mainstream schools, and a symbol version being delivered at two non-mainstream schools. [This video](https://youtu.be/vt5fpE0bzSY) below provides a helpful introduction to the survey. It was designed to introduce young people to the survey. You can find out more about the survey at <https://kailo.community/beewell/>.

We planned to share results from the survey will be shared using dashboards (with dashboards for school-level and area-level dashboards). These are publically available with synthetic data. These have been produced using Streamlit.
